# Supervised Learning Comparing Trainable Classifiers.

My partner & I implemented two classifying algorithms in Python, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest. 

We trained them on the same data set and tested them on a separate data set. After testing them, we would compare several metric about our classifiers such as time, accuracy, number of false positives, and if there are any significant outliers.

The project guidelines are as follows:
